Cigar: [[Diesel Whiskey Row Robusto]]
# Context:
## Storage:
Cupboard tupperdor, 69% boveda
## Environment
Walking Pip, winter (13 deg F, not very windy, relatively mild)
# **Construction**: (23 / 30)

## Appearance and Feel: (8 / 10)
Nice deep brown wrapper, bands are well done (understated but attractive). However, both foot band and main band removed large pieces of the wrapper (especially main band, which fully exposed a large chunk of the binder). Penalty for band removal problems placed in impression
## Draw: (7 / 10)
Started out about perfect, if a bit tight. Final third tightened up a bit
## Burn: ( 8/ 10)
Burn was very solid. Only required a few minor touch-ups despite sub-optimal environment
# **Flavor**: (40 / 45)
## First Third: (12)
First few puffs had strong spice, but that quickly faded to predominantly Earth and Leather, with some salt
## Second Third: (14)
Still Earth and Leather, but a Bourbon/Caramel sweetness coming through (esp on retrohale). Baking spices starting to appear as well (cinnamon, clove). A bit of Salted Caramel
## Final Third: (14)
Baking Spice, Earth, Caramel sweetness and Bourbon increasing when smoked slower, still a bit of saltiness. Strength ramping up. Good to the last puff
# **Impression**: (15 / 25)
Penalty for foot band and main band tearing off large chunks of wrapper. Also for a few cracks. However, cigar still smoked well and burned consistently despite this so very solidly made. Overall a bit spicier than I would prefer, but when those Bourbon/Salted Caramel notes come to the fore it's a great stick.
# **Additional Info**:
## Dominant Flavors:
Earth, Leather, baking spice, bourbon, caramel, salt
## Strength: (4 / 5)

## Smoke Time:
1 hour approx, would have been better if slower
