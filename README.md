Some Obsidian Templates that I made that others might find useful.

# Install Guide

## Set up Obsidian
1) Go to `Settings > Community Plugins` and toggle off `Restricted Mode` (aka enable community plugins)
2) Search for and install `Dataview`, `Templater`, and `Meta Bind`
3) Configure `Templater`
- Make a folder called z_Templates (or use your existing templates folder)
- Go to `Settings > Templater` and set the `Template Folder Location` to z_Templates (or your own folder)

## Import the Templates
Two options here:
1) Manually - For each template file you're interested in...
- Open the file on GitHub
- Toggle to `Code` view (top left of the preview window, will likely default to `Preview`)
- Copy all of the contents
- Make a new file in your templates folder with the same name
- Paste the contents
2) Bulk Download
- Download the files/folder you're interested from GitHub
- In Obsidian, open the `Vault Selection window` (click on the name of your vault below the file browser pane, then select `Manage Vaults...`)
- Select the three dot menu next to your vault, then `Reveal vault in system explorer`
- Copy the files you downloaded to your templates folder

## Use the templates
See the individual ReadMe files for instructions on how to use each template (ie - `Personal\z_Templates\Cigar Inventory Template Readme`)
